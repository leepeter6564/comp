# Assignment 1: How to Python
Hey guys, welcome to Python! Let's start you off on your magical journey by learning some syntax!

If at any point you have an issue, let Tiffany (haotian.wu@thecrimson.com) or Kyle (kyle.kwong@thecrimson.com) know! Don't bash your head against the wall. We're here to help.

## Instructions
Do you have python 2.7 installed? Let's find out! Try typing `python --version` in your terminal. If you don't have it, please consult us, or the internet, for help ASAP.

### Tips
- Write your code as "Pythonically" as possible.
- If it seems like there should be an easier way to do it, there probably is. Use library functions where appropriate.
- Test your code! It makes providing feedback a lot easier <3. Thanks baes :)
  
## Step(s) to it
###swapchars
Write a function that takes one (1) string argument. Return that string with the most common letter swapped with the least common letter.

    >>> swapchars('I\'m just a chi-town coder with a nice flow.')
    "I'm jcst a uhi-town uoder with a niue flow."
You can break ties however you want! (psst! check out [Counters](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter))

### sortcat
Write a function that takes one (1) integer argument _n_  and 
**an arbitrary number** of string arguments. Return the concatenation 
of the longest _n_  arguments from longest to shortest. If _n_  is -1, 
concatenate all the arguments in this fashion.
 
    >>> sortcat(1, 'abc', 'bc')
    'abc'
    >>> sortcat(2, 'bc', 'c', 'abc')
    'abcbc'

### Blue's Clues
Blue just got a letter! She'd like to know where it's coming from, but 
the return address's state is listed as "PA" and Blue has no idea what 
state that corresponds to. (come on guys, she's a dog. you can't expect 
much.)

We've provided a file called `states.txt` that contains all the state 
names and their abbreviations in the following form.

    Alabama,AL
    Alaska,AK
    ...
    Wyoming,WY

We'd like you to open the file and read its contents into a dictionary 
indexed by abbreviation. For example:

    abbrev["AL"] = "Alabama"

Then write a function that takes in a state abbreviation and returns the 
full name of the state. Print out what state Blue's letter is coming from
via a print statement!

### Blue's Booze
Blue owns a vineyard (she's really made it big since her hit TV show) 
and needs to ship wine to Nebraska. However, she doesn't know what the 
state abbreviation is! 

Using your dictionary from above, write a function that takes in the 
full name of a state and returns the state's abbreviation. Then use your 
function and help Blue out!

How might you modify your solution if you knew she has to ship wine to 
several states?

# Feedback?
You're done! Congrats! Just email us the file, and you can wipe your hands 
of the whole thing. Before you go though, **please fill out [this feedback
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KS7CiNRPHC2baAVUTx-ruNFBJW4Ixsnksnz3DpjHVgI/viewform)
about this assignment**; we'll use your answers to make the comp better 
 in the future. Thanks, dude!
